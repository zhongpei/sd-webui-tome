# ToMe

Extension for [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).

**Important**: Follow the installation guide to install `tomesd` first here: https://github.com/dbolya/tomesd#installation (I will make this process automatic [once the package is published to pip](https://github.com/dbolya/tomesd/issues/3))

Needs to be enabled in settings *before* loading the model. Furthermore, all settings are only applied at model load time.

Full disclaimer that I only implemented this because the library basically makes it an incredibly simple one-line change. If it doesn't work for you, wait for somebody else to implement it and add more compatibility layers. And in the meantime be sure to check out [iwf.gay](https://iwf.gay/). :^)
