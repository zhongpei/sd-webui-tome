# ToMe

Extension for [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).

**Important**: Follow the installation guide to install `tomesd` first here: https://github.com/dbolya/tomesd#installation (this may change so I am not making it part of the extension install)

Needs to be enabled in settings *before* loading the model.

Full disclaimer that I only implemented this because the library basically makes it an incredibly simple one-line change. If it doesn't work for you, wait for somebody else to implement it and add more compatibility layers. And in the meantime be sure to check out [iwf.gay](https://iwf.gay/). :^)
